# Electron-vue (Updated)

## Overview

The aim of this project is to remove the need of manually setting up electron apps using vue. electron-vue takes advantage of `vue-cli` for scaffolding, `webpack` with `vue-loader`, `electron-packager` or `electron-builder`, and some of the most used plugins like `vue-router`, `vuex`, and so much more.


#### Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron application for production
npm run build

# run unit & end-to-end tests
npm test


# lint all JS/Vue component files in `src/`
npm run lint

```
